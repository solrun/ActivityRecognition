# Activity Recognition

Assignment for WASP Autonomous Systems course, Group WASP_AS_M1_Chalmers1.

## How to run:
The code runs in a Jupyter notebook, [signal_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/solrun/ActivityRecognition/blob/main/signal_analysis.ipynb).

To run activity recognition on a data log file, call the method `print_activity_prediction` with the file path as an argument. 

### Requirements
Python (>= 3.8) including packages for Jupyter, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy.


## Data:
The data we collected is in the folders [running](https://github.com/solrun/ActivityRecognition/tree/main/running), [walking](https://github.com/solrun/ActivityRecognition/tree/main/walking), [standing still](https://github.com/solrun/ActivityRecognition/tree/main/standing_still), and [test data](https://github.com/solrun/ActivityRecognition/tree/main/test_data).
